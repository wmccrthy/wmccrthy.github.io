                <h3>Motivation</h3>
                <p>Professor-student communication has an undeniably major impact on the student experience. In general, a sense of transparency is extremely useful for students in their success with a course. If a student knows exactly what is demanded of them and when it is demanded, the failure to uphold such a standard falls largely on the student rather than factors that are out of anyoneâ€™s hands, symptoms of the system. It would be difficult or impossible, however, to implement a policy that forces one-on-one student-professor interaction on a frequent basis. As such, we believe that access to a platform/database that provides transparent, detailed information on courses, their content, and their professors, would greatly aid the student body at Amherst College. Such a resource would be maintained by the college and functionally serve as a catalog that students could utilize to discern which courses best suit their learning goals and styles during registration and how to navigate those courses once enrolled and amidst them. Similarly, having this database publicly accessible would likely encourage professors to further consider the student experience in their course and how they could approach optimizing student learning. </p>

                <p>
                    Through this website, we hope to bring attention to the information asymmetry associated with the pre-course selection process and create a more supportive community where students can choose courses that are best suited to their learning styles. By doing so, we believe that professors will receive students who are more engaged in their coursework, which will have a positive impact on the classroom environment and overall student experience.
                    Additionally, our approach aims to influence faculty and student attitudes towards course selection. We hope that students will be more inclined to choose harder subjects if they know that their professors are supportive and that they can succeed in them. By providing more information about courses ahead of time, such as syllabi and course evaluations,  we hope to encourage students to take on classes that they know they can succeed in.
                    Finally, we hope that our project will bridge the gap between athlete and non-athlete information asymmetry; athletes are typically privy to information about courses ahead of time as they often have an established support system with upperclassmen who have taken a wide array of classes. By providing all students with equal access to information about courses, we hope to level the playing field and create a more equitable academic environment at Amherst.
