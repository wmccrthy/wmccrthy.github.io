                    Through this website, we hope to bring attention to the information asymmetry associated with the pre-course selection process and create a more supportive community where students can choose courses that are best suited to their learning styles. By doing so, we believe that professors will receive students who are more engaged in their coursework, which will have a positive impact on the classroom environment and overall student experience.
                    Additionally, our approach aims to influence faculty and student attitudes towards course selection. We hope that students will be more inclined to choose harder subjects if they know that their professors are supportive and that they can succeed in them. By providing more information about courses ahead of time, such as syllabi and course evaluations,  we hope to encourage students to take on classes that they know they can succeed in.
                    Finally, we hope that our project will bridge the gap between athlete and non-athlete information asymmetry; athletes are typically privy to information about courses ahead of time as they often have an established support system with upperclassmen who have taken a wide array of classes. By providing all students with equal access to information about courses, we hope to level the playing field and create a more equitable academic environment at Amherst.
