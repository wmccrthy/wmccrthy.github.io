                                <li> <p>As Sarah Schulman explains in A Reparative Manifesto, humans tend to interpret trivial disagreement and misunderstanding as adversarial or hostile in nature. This describes a dynamic that can arise due to a disconnect between professor intent and student experience; particularly when a student falls behind in a course, not due to a lack of effort or sincerity, but unclear and miscommunicated expectations.</p>

                            <li> <p>In Anthony Jack’s The Privileged Poor, he interviews an abundance of students from a variety of backgrounds who describe the shock that can accompany transitioning to college. No student condemns any institution or professor as trying to create this environment; instead, they discuss a system that fails to accommodate for the plethora of intersecting factors that comprise a student’s background and play an integral role in how they navigate college. Students discuss the inevitability of resentment arising in the face of such frustration; regardless of if they “want” to love their school or not. And who can blame them?</p>
                             </li>
                            <li>Quote: <p>"When it comes to higher education, the privileged poor are those who are privy to the hidden curriculum of college-going. They know what courses to take, which professors to avoid, how to write an effective email to a professor, and the importance of office hours. They know what to wear to a networking event and how to make a good first impression" (p. 22).

                            <li> <p>This piece discusses how microaggressions and inequalities can be nearly invisible and often undetectable unless you are looking for them; we think that this relates to the previous source as students might not even be aware of how they are disadvantaged unless it is brought to their attention. We think that the information asymmetry associated with navigating college and course selections is reflective of the inequality between students and unequal exposure students have to these elite spaces and norms prior to college.</p>

                            <li> <p>We think that this article is incredibly important and relevant to our project as it talks about how by establishing a supportive and personalized community students are able to thrive. More specifically, we found that the “Navigational Capital” section was incredibly helpful as it talked about how the skills of navigating social institutions are so integral to success in higher education. The “Navigational Capital” section also raised questions for us regarding whether we should include demographic identifiers on reviews or trigger warnings for coursework; we could potentially partner with the Office for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion for this.</p>

                        <ul> <li>Review comments from the 2016 HSTEM interview project (10 minutes)
                            <li> <p>This article is really interesting because it discusses the barriers to succeed within STEM in university and is derived exclusively from the STEM community at Amherst. The  disparities within the STEM high school preparation students attain and corresponding unfamiliarity with the demands of Amherst coursework is exactly why we think our project will provide tangible benefits for incoming students. By providing a access to otherwise ‘insider’ information prior to registration, students will have the opportunity to supplement their knowledge prior to their first semester at Amherst; perhaps for introductory classes there could be an ‘assumed knowledge’ section.</p>
                             </li>
                            <li>Quote: <p>“There are massive differences in the level of high school preparation among incoming students. While more prepared students may view introductory classes as review, others are overwhelmed with the speed they are expected to learn brand new material.
                                Professors assume certain knowledge and may skip over material that some students have not been exposed to. To many students who feel less prepared, the lack of preparation comes as a complete shock.
                                A student's high school science experience--positive or negative, over- or under-preparatory--tends to dictate the tenor of his or her experience in Amherst STEM courses.”

                    <h4>Quotes from Forum</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>“This material was so much from lived experience and the results from studies and arguments in the book were very well laid out. Spending a long time defining Privileged Poor and Doubly Disadvantaged really made the small pieces of evidence and stories in the book fit together. The learned skills (like attending office hours and having experience chatting with academic authority figures) that differ based on high school experiences can seem invisible, but giving terms to them and comparing the categories brought a “why” to a lot of hidden stresses in college academics.” - Mia Bawendi
                            <li>
                                <p>This describes a big part of our project; students who have no experience in elite academic spaces prior to Amherst may not understand the demands of their courses and the college in general. This is precisely the demographic of people we hope our project will help. Our project hopes to make the expectations for student effort and engagement as transparent as possible. Many students who have not experienced similar academic environments before may not understand these demands without the help of resources.</p>

                            “Before doing this reading, I did not know just how underrepresented some groups are in the STEM world. I had already thought that some groups had a greater representation than others, but not to the degree shown in these papers. Even before looking at the composition of workforces, in colleges few minorities and women finish a major in STEM. This may very well be the root of the problem, in order to raise representation, the issues keeping these groups from pursuing an education in this field must be resolved.” - Leandro Brantley 
                            
                            <li>
                                <p>Leo’s point about how women and minorities finish STEM majors at lower rates speaks to some of the problems that can spiral out of disconnects due to lack of transparency regarding courses and how to succeed in them.</p>

                    <h4>Our Personal Connection with this Issue</h4>
                    <li><p>My (Simon’s) personal experience with this issue was from a transfer student’s perspective. I was an incoming sophomore who was unfamiliar with Amherst courses or professors and due to my unfamiliarity, I was reliant on websites such as RateMyProfessor or loose word of mouth to make an informed decision; it was really difficult for me to reach out to students or future-teammates who I hadn’t met before. I think that's why this resource could be so beneficial not only for current students but also for incoming freshmen.</p></li>
                    <li><p>My (Wyatt’s) entire college experience has been plagued with the issue we hope to address. On various occasions throughout my college career, I have enrolled and taken a course that was far from what I expected and extremely difficult to navigate; often not because the content itself was difficult, but the professor was extremely unclear of the expectation and specific work required to succeed in the class. This has always been extremely frustrating, and makes it feel impossible to do well regardless of my effort.</p></li>

                        Our project’s end goal is to improve the student experience at Amherst by providing students with more information and transparency about their courses before they register for them. We aim to bridge the disconnect between professor/department/institutional intentions and the student learning experience by establishing a website that is accessible to students, faculty, and incoming students.
        Through this website, we hope to bring attention to the information asymmetry associated with the pre-course selection process and create a more supportive community where students can choose courses that are best suited to their learning styles. By doing so, we believe that professors will receive students who are more engaged in their coursework, which will have a positive impact on the classroom environment and overall student experience.
        Additionally, our approach aims to influence faculty and student attitudes towards course selection. We hope that students will be more inclined to choose harder subjects if they know that their professors are supportive and that they can succeed in them. By providing more information about courses ahead of time, such as syllabi and course evaluations,  we hope to encourage students to take on classes that they know they can succeed in.
        Finally, we hope that our project will bridge the gap between athlete and non-athlete information asymmetry; athletes are typically privy to information about courses ahead of time as they often have an established support system with upperclassmen who have taken a wide array of classes. By providing all students with equal access to information about courses, we hope to level the playing field and create a more equitable academic environment at Amherst.

                        The main difference arising from the implementation of our project is that there will be an accessible tool for students to appraise their compatibility with classes prior to the registration period. Rather than, or perhaps supplementary to, the word of mouth of other students, individuals will have accessibility to a more rigid and comprehensive medium to view the courses' contents and demands.It may be challenging to quantitatively measure the impact of the project since it pertains to the dynamic and subjective personal student experience. A quantifiable indicator of the projects’ impact may however be a  significant reduction in the add/drop period's movement rate or one could monitor the user traffic of the website. Additionally, one could conduct a qualitative survey and assess student satisfaction with their courses before comparing it to outcomes prior to the implementation of the website.

                    </ul>
                    <h4>Incorporating the HSTEM Process</h4>
                    <p>Step 1 (Listening): During the Chi Salon, we received and listened to very valuable feedback from faculty members and our peers. Our peers consistently reiterated that students do not have the same access to course information, prompting us to really get the ball rolling on our project. Furthermore, faculty and staff members emphasized that we need to gather feedback from faculty and students about what kind of information is most useful to include in a syllabus.</p>

                    <p>Step 2 (Validating): Despite the continuing disconnects, we plan to acknowledge the intent and efforts of the humans involved in the initiatives we explored when Listening. We want to utilize their opinions and knowledge to fuel our project. Their lived experiences and aspirations for the precourse process are the foundation on which our project will be built. Utilizing our calling-in model and our HSTEM community agreements we will validate the Amherst STEM community while still critiquing and pushing for change. </p>

                    <p>Step 3 (Reflecting): When reflecting, we have found many cases of our disconnect in the Amherst community. In particular, we wanted to address the fact that students forum reflections and responses showcased the prevalence of our disconnect. Students consistently showcased the difference between a professor/department/institution's intention and actual student learning experience. Furthermore, dialogue with classmates during the various course selection periods further showcases the need to address this disconnect. We have been impacted directly by the disconnect. Wyatt and I (Niall) came into Amherst in our freshman year with little to no information about the reality of academics at Amherst. Similarly, Simon is a transfer student that had to make course decisions coming into his sophomore year with a completely different schooling background and no prior knowledge of Amherst courses. By being more informed and guided, we would have been able to make a far more educated decision. Further, our actual course and semester experiences would have been more aligned with what we thought we had signed up for. Through our direct experience with the disconnect, it became clear to see what things need to be incorporated and changed in order to tackle it. 
                    </p>

                    <p>Step 4 (Partnering): Our project amplifies efforts made by the Center for Teaching and Learning. They are in the process of incorporating a syllabus archive of sorts as well. We plan to be receptive and grateful of the work they have already accomplished. We will then offer our own thoughts and opinions, and hopefully reach a common understanding of the intentions of both parties. By combining efforts, we really aspire that our partnership with them will create a cohesive effort that will help faculty and students in the precourse process. By gaining the perspective of outside sources, we are able to acknowledge our own assumptions and biases that might be prevalent. The feedback forms helped a lot with this.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Grounding in HSTEM</h4>
                    <p>We have used the work and ideas of relevant HSTEM projects as part of our research. One such project is the “Mammoth Pre-Med Survival Guide.” This guide provides beneficial information and tips for pre-med majors throughout their Amherst careers. Since this major has such particular requirements, it is imperative that students embarking on this academic path have correct and useful information. We plan to expand on their proposal by providing information for all majors and courses while still utilizing similar subsections as they did in their layout. Another relevant HSTEM project is “Easing the anxiety of office hours.” This project showcases the need for better information about office hours. What we are proposing is complementary to this, as we want to make information about office hours course specific rather than generalized. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Another area to look at to add to this section of research would be how our precourse process platform can be utilized at the preparatory school level. Because of the academic rigor of these institutions, it is imperative that students have proper knowledge of their schooling system from a young age. This will help them through a period of time in which they are finding out their interests as an academic.</p>
                    <p>One specific campus partner whose work is related to this issue is The Center for Teaching and Learning. The Center for Teaching and Learning at Amherst College helps to achieve the goal of providing a rigorous liberal arts education in an inclusive learning community. They collaborate with faculty and staff to address the challenges of teaching and learning in a globalized and digital world, using evidence-based practices. They provide support for course and curriculum design, assessment, and pedagogical concerns through consultations, observation, feedback, and evaluation planning.</p>
                    <p>We envision creating a collaborative partnership based on calling in and assuming best intentions with campus partners. One campus partner in particular would be the administration. By utilizing them, we will be able to validate the Amherst STEM community as they are crucial to make what we do more official. Another way to use the calling-in model within the HSTEM community to create a collaborative partnership is to start by acknowledging the strengths and accomplishments of the community. This can involve recognizing the hard work and dedication of HSTEM students, faculty, and staff, and highlighting the successes of HSTEM programs and initiatives. From there, we can begin to have more difficult conversations about areas where we need to improve. This might involve discussing issues like lack of diversity or inclusivity within HSTEM programs, or challenges faced by HSTEM students and faculty in navigating the academic and social aspects of their work.</p>
