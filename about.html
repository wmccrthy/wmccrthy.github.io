                <p>Hi. My name is Wyatt McCarthy and I'm currently a student at Amherst College in the class of 2024. I am a Computer Science major with extensive coursework in Economics, in which I may double major. At Amherst, I am a member of the men's varsity soccer team. I have played soccer since I was a toddler and probably committed more time to playing than any other activity in my life. In highschool I played in the Development Academy where I spent time with Metropolitan Oval and NYCFC.</p> 
                <p>In my coursework at Amherst College, I have focused largely on computer science and economics. Throughout, I have completed several courses relevant to software engineering, quantitative problem-solving, and data analysis including data structures, algorithms, artificial intelligence, microeconomics, macroeconomics, and industrial organization, and I will soon (as of Spring 2023) have completed computer systems and algorithm visualization. I have also worked on several projects that have given me practical experience in developing and implementing software solutions. In particular, I have advanced experience programming in Java and Python, as well as experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and C. I have used these skills to develop projects such as a pathfinding algorithm visualizer, a checkers game with a minimax AI that plays against the user, various artificial intelligence agents for Pacman, and a personal website. 
                </p>
                <p> In the medium term, I hope to use the education I've recieved at Amherst alongside a passion I've gained for coding to become a software engineer. In the long run, I hope to somehow align my interest in programming with my passions for fitness, sport and entrepreneurship.</p>
